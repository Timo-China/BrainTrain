# BrainTrain
4th semester group project, graphic demo with OpenSceneGraph.
Most code is made by me, with a few exceptions.
The headers should state the individual author, though.
Files without an explicit author are the files where everyone of us contributed to.

All models are made with Blender by Sebastian HÃ¼ttermann.  
Toon textures are made by Pia Bsdurrek.
